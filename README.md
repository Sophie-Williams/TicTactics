# TicTactics
A bot for the game TicTactics

----

This is an alpha-beta pruning implementation for the game [Tic-Tactics](http://gamewise.co/games/50857/Tic-Tactics)
which is very similar to the well-known Tic-Tac-Toe but a lot harder to solve.

Note that the Searcher itself operates entirely encapsulated from the gamestate itself and can be applied to any
game that fulfills the game-concept outlined in src/Searcher.hpp
